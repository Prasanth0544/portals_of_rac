## Post Templates

### Template 1: Story-Based (Recommended)

```
🚂 Just completed a full-stack Railway RAC Seat Reallocation System! 

THE PROBLEM:
When passengers miss trains, their confirmed seats go empty - but RAC passengers remain in waiting. Current manual reallocation is slow and inefficient.

THE SOLUTION:
Built a real-time automated system with:
✅ 3 specialized portals (Admin, TTE, Passenger)
✅ 85 REST APIs with WebSocket real-time updates
✅ Smart segment-based berth tracking
✅ Push notifications for instant upgrade alerts
✅ 79.57% test coverage (1,153 tests)

TECH STACK:
🔹 Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
🔹 Frontend: React 19, Vite, Material-UI
🔹 Real-time: WebSocket, Web Push API
🔹 Security: JWT, CSRF protection, Rate limiting

📊 PROJECT STATS:
• 40,000+ lines of code
• 85 API endpoints
• 50 test suites
• Deployed & live!

### Template 3: Technical Deep-Dive

```
💡 Technical Case Study: Building a Complex Railway Management System

Challenge: Design a real-time seat reallocation system for trains with 500+ passengers

Architecture Decisions:
1️⃣ Microservices approach with 3 independent frontends
2️⃣ WebSocket for instant notifications (no polling!)
3️⃣ Segment-based tracking (same berth, multiple passengers)
4️⃣ MongoDB collections per train/date for scalability

Key Features:
🔸 Real-time vacant berth detection
🔸 Automatic RAC-to-CNF upgrade offers
🔸 30-second countdown for upgrade decisions
🔸 TTE action history with undo capability
🔸 Multi-train support with dynamic initialization

Performance:
⚡ Handles 500+ passengers per train
⚡ <100ms API response times
⚡ Real-time updates via WebSocket
⚡ Push notifications work even when browser closed

Tech Stack: MERN + WebSocket + Web Push API

📱 Live Demo Available | ⭐ Open to feedback!
