## 🔔 Upgrade Offer Flow

```
1. TTE approves your RAC upgrade
   └── You receive push notification

2. Open "Upgrade Offers" page
   └── See countdown timer (5 minutes default)

3. View offer details
   ├── Current: RAC berth (e.g., S1-72)
   └── Upgrade: CNF berth (e.g., S1-15, Lower Berth)

4. Choose action
   ├── ACCEPT → Get upgraded to CNF
   └── DENY → Stay in RAC, offer goes to next passenger

5. After acceptance
   └── Download new boarding pass with QR code
```

---

## 🔔 Push Notifications

The portal sends browser push notifications for:

| Event | Notification |
|-------|--------------|
| **Upgrade Available** | "You have a new upgrade offer! Tap to view" |
| **Offer Expiring** | "Your upgrade offer expires in 1 minute" |
| **Upgrade Confirmed** | "Congratulations! You've been upgraded to CNF" |
| **No-Show Marked** | "You've been marked as no-show by TTE" |

**How it works:**
1. User grants notification permission
2. Browser creates push subscription
3. Subscription stored in MongoDB
4. Backend sends push via VAPID keys
5. Notification appears even when browser is closed

Requires HTTPS in production (localhost exempt).
